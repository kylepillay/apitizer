## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

APItizer is a web application built using ReactJS and styled using Tailwind CSS. Its primary purpose is to test REST APIs by simulating HTTP requests and responses. The application consists of several components, such as input fields for specifying the request method, URL, headers, and body, as well as output fields for displaying the response status, headers, and body. The application also supports authentication and authorization by allowing users to set custom headers and cookies. The use of ReactJS allows for a modular and scalable design, while Tailwind CSS provides a simple and efficient way to style the application. Overall, this project is a powerful tool for developers to test and debug REST APIs.
